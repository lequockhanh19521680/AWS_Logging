We are implementing a new FinTech use case.

Context:

- Follow .trae/architecture.md strictly
- Follow rules in .trae/rules.md
- Respect Ledger-first and [FLOW-01]

For this use case, always specify:

1. API design
2. Validation rules
3. Ledger impact (if any)
4. Transaction boundary
5. Events published (after commit only)

Do not skip steps.
Do not assume shortcuts.
